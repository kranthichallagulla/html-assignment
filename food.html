     <h1>Groceries</h1>
     <p>Online grocery ordering is the process of grocery delivery or takeout from a local stores through a web page
        or app.
        Much like ordering consumer goods online, many of these services allow customers to keep accounts with
        them in order to make frequent ordering convenient.
      </p>
      <p> A customer will search for a favorite restaurant,
        usually filtered via type of cuisine and choose from available items, and choose delivery or pick-up.
